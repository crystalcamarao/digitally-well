Technology is a tool. Unfortunately, we don’t always utilize it properly. With the way the internet 2.0 is designed, it’s easy to waste your precious time mindlessly scrolling and tapping. Our aim is to share evidence-based strategies to help you improve your relationship with tech, and stay up to date on how the evolution of technology is shaping society. We want to contribute to a paradigm shift in how people use technology, focusing on awareness, intention, and true social connectivity.
